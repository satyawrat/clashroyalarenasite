**Hi everyone.**
Today I'm going to be telling you about a new puzzle game. Now it's just gone into beta and I'll be telling you at the end of the video how to sign up for the beta and the game will officially be launched mid-october. 

## An Android Puzzle Game With a Great Story
Now this is Ghosts of Memories, a 3d puzzle game that has really been handmade. All of the artwork has been drawn out beautifully here. Now this is not necessarily your usual kind of puzzle game. This is much more a kind of exploration puzzle game, not really your Angry Birds action puzzle game, as it were. You play a lone wanderer from an empty world who discovers a mysterious sceptre. That sceptre has the power to travel across dimensions and thanks to a vision of another lone soul you set off to try and, well, rescue them. Now the beta features six levels but the final game will feature 15. 

What I found really interesting here is not just the art style that feels just gorgeous to look at, literally like every single penny is dripping off the screen but also the game play. It isn't unashamedly easy, it wants to challenge you and it wants to make you think. It's not a game that necessarily lays everything out in little tiny steps for you. It points the way but it allows you to find your own solutions. 

### Unlocking New Worlds
Now the idea here really is you have to traverse across the map lighting these various orbs using your sceptre. Certain orbs can only be lit using particular colours so you'll have to work your way around the map lighting things up in the right order. 

### It is Neither Hard, Nor Easy
As you do you'll unlock new areas of the map that you can kind of get to and ultimately complete the level move on to the next world. Like I say the game play here is really fun and engaging. It's not particularly easy but at the same time it's not so difficult you find yourself just getting frustrated. There's a good balance that's been struck here between the difficulty of obviously a puzzle game that's not so simple you blow through it in two or three minutes, but at the same time something that keeps you nicely engaged. To my mind this feels like a triple A title because quite a lot of love and attention has gone in here. 

## Attention To Detail
Each world feels different and each set of puzzles feels different as well building on top of what you've learned from the past level. But each level has had its own music crafted for it. This isn't just a simple case of buying some stock footage in and throwing some music into a game. It actually feels like this has been lovingly crafted to really aid the journey and discovery that you're going on. It's gorgeous to listen to, really a good one for headphones I'd say. Now in this day and age finding games that aren't replete with violence and blood and gore and heads exploding is a pretty difficult challenge but this is a game which is very much made for everyone. This is a family title. You won't find anything here that you wouldn't be happy allowing your child to play which is a really good thing I think because we do have far too many games I think these days which are just a little bit too OTT when it comes to who they're targeting, adults only essentially. So it's really nice and refreshing to find a puzzle game that is really made for everybody and is actually quite accessible to people of all skill levels as well.
