Now, as I say Ghosts of Memories will be launching around the middle of October, developers tell me October 16th. Now in the meantime if you'd like to get into this beta to have a play yourself, head over to the Ghosts of Memories dot com website where you can not only sign up for the beta but you can check out some full motion video as it were, really setting up what the game is all about. So I hope you've enjoyed this look at Ghosts of Memories and I will be back in the near future. Hi everyone. Today I'm going to be telling you about a new puzzle game. Now it's just gone intobeta and I'll be telling you at the end of the video how to sign up for the beta and the game will officially be launchedmid-October. Now this is Ghosts of Memories, a 3d puzzle game that hasreally been handmade. All of the artwork has been drawn out beautifully here. Nowthis is not necessarily your usual kind of puzzle game. This is much more a kind ofexploration puzzle game, not really your Angry Birds action puzzle game, as it were. You playa lone wanderer from an empty world who discovers a mysterious sceptre. That sceptrehas the power to travel across dimensions and thanks to a vision ofanother lone soul you set off to try and, well, rescue them. Now the beta features sixlevels but the final game will feature 15. What I foundreally interesting here is not just the art style that feels justgorgeous to look at, literally like every single penny is dripping off the screenbut also the game play. It isn't unashamedly easy, it wants to challenge youand it wants to make you think. It's not a game that necessarily lays everything outin little tiny steps for you. It points the way but it allows you to find your ownsolutions.Now the idea here really is you have to traverse across the map lighting thesevarious orbs using your sceptre. Certain orbs can only be lit using particular colours soyou'll have to work your way around the map lighting things up in the rightorder. As you do you'll unlock new areas of the map that you can kind of get to andultimately complete the level move on to the next world.Like I say the game play here is really fun and engaging. It's not particularlyeasy but at the same time it's not so difficult you find yourself just gettingfrustrated. There's a good balance that's been struck here between the difficulty ofobviously a puzzle game that's not so simple you blow through it in two or three minutes, but at thesame time something that keeps you nicely engaged. To my mind this feelslike a triple A title because quite a lot of love and attention has gone inhere. Each world feels different and each set of puzzles feels different as wellbuilding on top of what you've learned from the past level. But each level hashad its own music crafted for it. This isn't just a simple case of buying somestock footage in and throwing some music into a game. It actually feels like this hasbeen lovingly crafted to really aid the journey and discovery that you're going on. It'sgorgeous to listen to, really a good one for headphones I'd say. Now in this day andage finding games that aren't replete with violence and blood and gore andheads exploding is a pretty difficult challenge but this is a game which isvery much made for everyone. This is a family title. You won't find anythinghere that you wouldn't be happyallowing your child to play which is a really good thing I think because we do havefar too many games I think these days which are just a little bit too OTT whenit comes to who they're targeting, adults onlyessentially. So it's really nice and refreshing to find a puzzle game that isreally made for everybody and is actually quite accessible to people ofall skill levels as well.
